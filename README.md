# Online_News_Popularity_Predict
In this project, implement linear regression algorithm from scratch and then use it  to predict popularity of news. This is based on a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+News+Popularity) from the UCI data repository. The dataset contains a total of 39797 examples. Each example is described in terms of 61 attributes, i.e. “shares” (continues numbers) as a class attribute, and 60 other features. These are in comma-separated-file format with the first row in the file listing the attribute names (separated by commas),  and remaining rows in the file giving the values of these attributes for single news i.e. each row contains a single example.  
Implement the linear regression learning algorithm described in class. You may use any programming language you like, but Don’t Use Any Libraries like (sklearn). You may use numpy, scipy, pandas.
